Assignments of CIT 5910 for Fall 2022

I have described a few interesting projects below.

Battleship Game (HW7):
Project Title: Object-Oriented Battleship Game
Description: This project is a Java-based implementation of the classic Battleship game. It features a complete gameplay experience where players can place ships of varying types (Battleship, Cruiser, Destroyer, Submarine) on a grid and attempt to sink their opponent's fleet. The project demonstrates advanced object-oriented programming concepts, including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Each ship type is a subclass of an abstract Ship class, with specific properties and behaviors. The game includes robust user interaction through the console and utilizes systematic testing with JUnit to ensure functionality.

Movie Trivia System (HW6):
Project Title: Movie Trivia and Database Management System
Description: This project is a comprehensive system for managing and querying a movie database. It involves reading movie and actor data from files, storing it in a structured format, and providing various functionalities to query and update the database. Key features include adding new movies, searching for movies by actors, and listing all movies with specific ratings. The system showcases skills in file I/O operations, data parsing, object-oriented design, and unit testing with JUnit. Classes like Movie, Actor, and MovieDB highlight a well-structured approach to data management.

Student Management System (HW8):
Project Title: Comprehensive Student Management System
Description: This project is a robust student management system designed to handle various administrative and academic aspects of a student's lifecycle. It includes functionalities for managing course enrollments, user roles (Admin, Professor, Student), and academic records. The system reads data from files, processes it, and provides an interactive interface for administrators and students to access and modify information. Key features include course scheduling, user authentication, and data integrity checks. The project is an excellent example of complex system development with a focus on object-oriented programming, file handling, and user interaction.
